# covid-testing-locations

## Synopsis:

This project is to help anyone with COVID-19 symptoms find COVID-19 testing locations in the city specified by the user.
The application is limited to cities in the United States.
The user will be able to use the input form on the application to search for COVID-19 testing locations in the specified city.
The application will then display to the user the locations found.
The search results will also display the addresses of the locations found.
The search result will also present the user with a map to give the user a visual of where the locations are situated.
